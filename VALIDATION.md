Appendix A (Rammed Earth Compositional Validation):
Since Tally's GaBi database does not include a pre-defined 'rammed earth' category,
 the material was reconstructed from constituent ingredients:
 1,300 kg coarse aggregate + 700 kg sand + 200 kg water + 0 kg Portland cement per m³ (total density 2,200 kg/m³).
 GaBi's component-based calculation yielded 29.1 kgCO₂/m³, representing European aggregate production averages.
 The 17% variance from the academic coefficient (34 kgCO₂/m³) is attributed to regional differences
 (Colombian vs. European production contexts), system boundary differences (local construction practices vs. industrial manufacturing assumptions),
 and energy mix variations (grid carbon intensity).
 Both values are valid;
 the academic coefficient was selected because it better represents project-specific regional contexts,
 aligning with the tool's intended application in location-specific early-stage design.

 Appendix B (Industry-Academia Coefficient Gap Root Cause Analysis):
 European C30 concrete (academic):
 280-320 kg cement/m³ content, 20-35% SCM replacement rate, material-optimized design approach under EN 206 efficiency-focused regulation,
 yielding approximately 317 kgCO₂/m³.
 North American 'C30' concrete (industry/GaBi): 335-390 kg cement/m³ content, 10-20% SCM replacement rate,
 safety-factor conservative design under ACI 318 durability-focused regulation, yielding approximately 390 kgCO₂/m³.
 The GaBi database's 'concrete' category defaults to structural-grade specifications (weighted average including commercial, industrial,
 and infrastructure applications) rather than residential-grade minimums.
 Academic coefficients represent achievable optimization; industry databases represent typical practice.
 This explains why the back-calculated GaBi coefficient (390.6) falls between C30 and C55 — it is a conservative industry baseline,
 rather than an optimized residential specification.
